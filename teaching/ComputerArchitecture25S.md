#### Course Instructor
[Prof. Seong Tae Kim](https://ami.khu.ac.kr/people/pi)

#### Time & Location
Fri. 09:00-11:45 @ Global Building, 405

#### Course Description
This course will provide lectures on traditional computer architectures. In particular, Computer Organization, Performance, Instruction Set Architecture, MIPS Processor, Pipelining, Superscalar, Multithreading, SIMD Processor, Cache, and Virtual Memory

#### Objectives
* To learn traditional CPU (Central Processing Unit) architecture applied for the state-of-the-art computer systems                    
* To learn how the programming language is translated to machine language                    
* To learn how CPU works based on machine language                           
* To understand memory system (cache, virtual memory)
