#### Computer Architecture (2025-Fall)

#### Time \& Location
Tue. 16:30-17:45, Thu. 16:30-17:45 @ College of Electronics Information, B07

#### Course Description
This course will provide lectures on traditional computer architectures. In particular, Computer Organization, Performance, Instruction Set Architecture, MIPS Processor, Pipelining, Superscalar, Multithreading, SIMD Processor, Cache, and Virtual Memory

#### Objectives
* To learn traditional CPU (Central Processing Unit) architecture applied for the state-of-the-art computer systems                    
* To learn how the programming language is translated to machine language                    
* To learn how CPU works based on machine language                           
* To understand memory system (cache, virtual memory)
